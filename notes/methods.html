  <h1>Questions</h1>
  <ul><li>Methods define behaviour</li>
      <li>We can invoke methods to execute the code within</li>
      <li>Every method has an access modifier
          <ul><li>Private: we can only invoke a method within that class</li>
              <li>Public: we can invoke a method from other classes within the same project</li>
          </ul></li>
          <li>The method has a return type
              <ul><li>Void: The method does not return a value it just executes the code inside but doesnt need a return statement to give anything back</li>
              </ul></li>
              <li>The method has a name</li>
              <li>The method has zero or more parameters: if a parameter is given it has a return type</li></ul>
        <ol><li><strong>Question: </strong>Which of the following is not part of a method signature in C#?
            <ul><li>The number of parameters</li>
                <li>The method name</li>
                 <li>The types of parameters</li>
                 <li>The return type</li>

                <p><strong>Answer:</strong><p>The return type: TODO Answer this question</p>
            </ol>
       <ol><li><strong>Question: </strong>What name do we give to the special methods used when creating an instance of a class?
            <ul><li>Intiliazers</li>
                <li>Constructors</li>
                 <li>Newers</li>
