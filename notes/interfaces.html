        Is it possible for a class to implement both of these interfaces, while keeping separate implementations of each?

public interface IOne { void DoSomething(string x); }
public interface ITwo { void DoSomething(string x); }
Correct -
Yes, but only if the class implements at least one of the DoSomething() methods explicitly.

Incorrect -
Yes, but only if both interfaces are declared to be contravariant.

Incorrect -
No. Implementing both interfaces will cause a compiler error because of the DoSomething() name collision.

Your choice: incorrect -
No, because both interfaces will necessarily share the DoSomething() implementation.
