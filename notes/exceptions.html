       What is the difference between these two code snippets?

var value1 = (MyClass)source;
and
var value2 = source as MyClass;
Incorrect -
If the conversion fails, then the first snippet sets value1 to null, but the second snippet throws an exception.

Incorrect -
The first snippet only compiles if an explicit cast exists from the type of source to MyClass, the second snippet requires an implicit cast to exist.

Correct -
If the conversion fails, then the first snippet throws an exception, but the second snippet sets value2 to null.

Your choice: incorrect -
value1 is statically typed as MyClass, but value2 is dynamically typed at runtime to the actual type source refers to.
  

To test a guard clause that throws an exception:

Correct -
There's an attribute for that.

Incorrect -
You can't test for exceptions.

Incorrect -
All of these.

Your choice: incorrect -
Set up the exception in the Test Explorer.
